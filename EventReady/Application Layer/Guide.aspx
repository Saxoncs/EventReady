                                <h4>1. Define your event's <br/> goals and objectives</h4>
                                <p>This includes looking into and establishing the event's purpose, <br/> the desired amount of people wanting to attend the  event, <br/>whether or not profit will be made from the event and how much of it will be made, <br/>whether tickets will be available to purchase and how much they'll cost, <br/> and where the event will take place,  <br/>including considering how patrons will travel to the venue in order to decide <br/> on a central event location for the target audience.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="item">
                                <h4>2. Budgeting</h4>
                                <p>The next step is to throw together a rough budget. <br/> A more detailed budgt will be formulated and refined leading up to the event as variables especially in relation to <br/>location, venue, vendors, and available funds for the event are easily subject to change. <br/>As an aid, you could look at past events similar to the event which you'll be organising <br/> and borrow their figures to use as a starting point. Then from there, <br/> use educated guesses and a bit of your own research to create a rough budget.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="item">
                                <h4>3. Deciding on the 'When'</h4>
                                <p>Choose the best possible date to hold your event.  <br/>Important considerations include weather, other conflicting events being held,  <br/>and availability of all stakeholders. Always have a backup option.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div class="item">
                                <h4>4. Deciding on the 'Where'</h4>
                                <p>Choose the best location suited for your event, taking into account what the weather will be like, <br/> the amount of people attending, whether technology is needed (powerpoints, Wi-Fi), <br/> is there a choice of local vendors in the area, does the location have the required infrastructure for <br/>the event or will you have to opt to provide your own.</p>
                            </div>

                                <p>Decide on your event's theme taking into account the target audience and people that will be attending, <br/> and the location. The theme will set the tone for the whole event. Once the theme is in place, <br/> it'll make planning decisions alot easier. It'll also drive the visual <br/> and creative design of your event and significantly aid in attracting attendees. <br/> When deciding on your theme, make sure it aligns with your event goals, audience, and venue.</p>

                                <h4>6. Research any guest speakers or special <br/> guests if you plan on having any</h4>
                                <p>A base to start from could be researching guest speakers from <br/> previous events that are similar to the once in which you're planning. <br/>From there compile a list of your  ideal speakers and the purpose they'll serve. <br/>The final step is to reach out and contact those speakers.</p>

                                <p>Again, a base to start from could be researching sponsors <br/> who have parternered with similar events in the past. <br/> Form a list of your ideal sponsors. When reaching out to sponsors, <br/>discuss the kind of activations your event could offer to them. Then finally, <br/> determine the market rate of your sponsorship packages for your event.</p>
